# Python_pyramids
Program to print full pyramids  

the program uses a nested loop to print the pyramid. The outer loop controls the number of rows in the pyramid, while the inner loop controls the number of stars in each row. The print statement uses string multiplication to print the correct number of spaces and stars on each row. This program is more concise and easier to read than the previous program, but it may not be as efficient for very large values of n.

For stupid people to print full pyramids. You can adjust the number of rows by changing the value of n
